# Pixel-dungeon-C++ [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
An effort of making the Pixel Dungeon game run with C++ 

The original idea and credits goes to : [Zhuzhonghua](https://github.com/zhuzhonghua/pixeldungeon_cpp)<br>
The idea is to port it to Linux and other distribs. The current code is (very) dirty.

## Current State : 
 - The game compile and run without errors. Black screen while game music is playing.
